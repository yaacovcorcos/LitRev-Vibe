# Module: `src/app`

Next.js App Router entry point for the LitRev-Vibe workspace.

## Current Structure
- `layout.tsx` — Root layout, fonts, color scheme, and future global providers.
- `page.tsx` — Temporary landing page placeholder until the real app shell is built.
- `globals.css` — Tailwind directives and CSS variable definitions shared with shadcn/ui.

## Planned Structure
- `project/` — Scoped routes (`planning`, `triage`, `ledger`, etc.).
- `runs/` — Jobs dashboard.
- `settings/` — Global and project settings.
- `api/` — App Router server actions (if required).

Keep this README updated as new routes or providers are added.
